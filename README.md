# Highlight

#### Description:
Highlight is a single-page note-taking app for readings built with Django. It allows users to create an account with an username and a password. Once the user is logged in, they can add a new note through a form where they must fill in the title of the note and its content. Optionally, users can also fill in four other fields useful for those who may wish to store more specific information on their readings: author, title of the book, publisher and year. The main page of Highlight shows all of the notes saved by the user currently logged in. The notes can be edited or deleted, and the user can also search through the notes. Finally, the user can access their account settings in order to change their password or delete their account along with all of their notes from the database. 

##### **First steps**
The back-end of my project is built with Django. I chose this framework instead of Flask mainly because I wanted to challenge myself to learn to work with a more complex and widely used framework for Python. I found Django to be relatively easy to pick up after the experience with Flask provided by CS50x. Brian's lectures in CS50's Introduction to Web Programming were also incredibly helpful and instructive.    
I worked on the project locally with Visual Studio Code and WSL on a Windows computer. After setting up a virtual environment and activating it, I downloaded Python and Django and created the project.

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them.
